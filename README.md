## Introduction
This is a script for Gen III Pokémon games to display EVs/IVs of enemy Pokémon and the current party.

This is designed for use with the [mGBA emulator](https://mgba.io/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba)) v0.10, and EN-US versions of all the games only.

After writing the script for Gen III (using the [Bulbapedia page](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_data_structure_(Generation_III))), I found a [very similar script](https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/blob/master/res/scripts/pokemon.lua) on the mGBA GitHub page by [endrift](https://github.com/endrift), which I've copied here because I am a bamf. After nearly deleting my work and throwing my laptop at the wall, I had a change of heart, since that script didn't have any sort of display for EVs/IVs, which I find most helpful.

## How to use
Run *main.lua* in the mGBA scripting tab.

## Future
If I really no-life it I would like to add a comparable Gen IV script, likely for DeSmuME (I don't think melonDS has easy scripting support)
